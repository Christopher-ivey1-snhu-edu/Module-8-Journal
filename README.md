# Module-8-Journal
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?


Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. Artemis Financial wants to modernize its web operations and their custom software, by implementing and applying the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a public web interface and is seeking Global Rain’s expertise in taking steps to protect their client data and financial information. Specifically, Artemis Financial wants to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. When the web application is used to transfer data, they will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum. Artemis Financial asked us to take their current software application and add secure communication mechanisms to meet their software security requirements.  
When assessing the vulnerabilities for the web application, I noticed that I recognized the vulnerabilities in the system quite well. I also coded the program securely, because security is one of the main components for web applications to be successful. Without security companies web applications could be vulnerable to attacks.
When working through the vulnerability assessment I found, that to find a solution and explain the solution in detail with nothing missing was challenging for me. As far as tools that I used to add more layers of security to the web application, I used the Java Security Standards Algorithm names. This is a list of standardized algorithms that provides a detailed description of various algorithms that can be implemented into a program to add security. The best coding practices is to test the software and see if the program is receiving any errors and then go through a fix those errors.

After refactoring the code, I would analyze the dependency check report to see what kind of vulnerabilities I was still getting. In addition, I would go through and see if there are any false positives that needed to be suppressed in the program. Then run the program and see of these have been suppressed in the new dependency check. Using the static testing tool will help to determine and ensure that the code complies with software security enhancements. This is a strategy that I will implement and use for future projects and employers. I would like to display to future companies that I am able to find vulnerabilities in the system if needed to mitigate them through mitigation techniques.
